# Deployment dev
In this folder are the needed scripts for k8s deployment which includes the custom microservices (UserManagement, FileManagement, FileMetadata, Billing, Notifications)
and also some existing solutions (RabbitMQ, S3, MinIO, PostgreSQL).

## Content of directories

The microservices are located in folders with the name of the microservices. Some of the shared configurations that are needed in multiple microservices are present in the shared folder.
The scripts folder contains a few scripts for cUrl and also postman collection of requests. Some of these scripts were used during testing and experiments.

##
To deploy the application you should ideally start from the independent services with following commands

`
kubectl apply -f shared
kubectl apply -f rabbitmq
kubectl apply -f minio

kubectl apply -f filemetadata
kubectl apply -f usermanagement
kubectl apply -f billing
kubectl apply -f notifications
kubectl apply -f filemanagement
`



Optional for monitoring

`
kubectl apply -f metrics
kubectl apply -f kubeernetes-ui
`


After this the creadentials to rabbitmq-cluster need to be configured. You can find them with the following commands:
`
kubectl exec -it service/rabbit-mq-cluster bash
cd /etc/rabbitmq/conf.d
cat 11-default_user.conf
`

Dont forget to encode them into BASE64 to use for as secrets
